# Time_Series_prediction-on-Air-Quality-in-India

this project is all about time series data
-how it looks like
-how to processes it
-remove outliers
-how to find our features in the data using shift
-build model for predicting next output
 and finally communicating the results

   Dataset used
   
   Air Quality in india which is a collection of observations for 5 years for 26 citys in india.
   but in this i only used city of "Ahmedabad" because of large observation than other cities.
   
ALGORITHM USED

1.trained on Linear regression model 
then evaluate.

2.train Autoeg model and utilizing walk forward validation technique.
